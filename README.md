# DatPartoutExplorer
Parses the PARTOUT(4.0)RESOURCE file format used by Maxis/Cinematronics in Full Tilt Pinball and displays the contents.

I started this project in June 2015. I used this [REWiki article](https://web.archive.org/web/20180221135500/http://rewiki.regengedanken.de:80/wiki/.DAT_(PARTOUT)) and [it's discussion page](https://web.archive.org/web/20180122030304/http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/Talk:.DAT_(PARTOUT)) for reference and made this [010 Editor Template](https://gist.github.com/belaw/01f22c91a7c073004096f34291943f6f) to figure out the rest of the file format.
